This is the frontend of a Concert Tickets Booking app, where users can view concert details and purchase tickets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/) for building the user interface and managing state
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling components
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for client-side form validations
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript testing

For icons, I used [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/).

I used [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) to generate promotional posters for the concerts.
